    <h1>The Lore</h1>
    <img src="sir_parsnip_vintage.png" alt="Illustration of Carrots Cannoli and Sir Parsnip" />
    <p>In a sunlit kitchen nestled between mountains and dreams, there lived a ginger cat with a heart full of love and a name as sweet as powdered sugar — Carrots Cannoli.</p>
    <p>Carrots watched the world from the window each day, his round frame curled on a cushion, waiting for someone dear to him: Sir Parsnip. This valiant companion had ventured out into the unknown, promising to return with tales of distant flavors and desserts yet discovered.</p>
    <p>In his absence, Carrots created something new — a tribute to the longing and joy of love held close. He imagined a place where comfort and sweetness lived side-by-side: a cannoli shop built on dreams, dough, and devotion.</p>
    <p>Sir Parsnip’s travels became the soul of the flavors; Carrots' quiet patience became the heart of the shop.</p>
    <p>And so, Carrots Cannoli was born. A shop, a love letter, and a cozy corner of the world where stories and sweetness are always served warm.</p>
