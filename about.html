  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Carrots Cannoli was born out of love, laughter, and a ginger cat named Carrots. It started as a daydream shared by two women in a tiny kitchen — one filled with the smell of espresso, the warmth of each other's company, and a cat who always found the sunniest spot on the floor.</p>
  <p>We believe desserts are more than just sweet treats — they're memories in the making, comfort in a bite, and love stories in sugar and cream. Our goal is to create a space (digital and maybe someday physical!) that feels like a hug from an old friend.</p>
  <p>We hope that Carrots Cannoli brings a little magic into your day, a reminder to savor the small moments, and maybe even the inspiration to follow your own sweet little dream.</p>
